\section{Introduction}
\epigraph{Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that
can be counted counts.}
{Albert Einstein}
Discrete frequency distributions often involve counts of occurrences
such as accident fatalities, words in passages of text,  births of twins,
events of terrorism or suicide, or blood
cells with some characteristic.  Typically such data consist of a
table which records that \(n_k\) of the observations pertain to the
basic outcome value \(k \,  , \,  k = 0 , 1, \dots\).
For such data, we often wish to understand the process which gives rise to
these numbers, or to estimate frequencies for outcome values $k$ we
did not observe.  Both goals can be approached by examining
how closely the data follow a particular discrete probability distribution, such as the Poisson, the binomial, or the geometric distribution.

We briefly describe the properties of some of the most widely used
discrete distributions in \secref{sec:discrete-distrib}, along with
SAS techniques for calculating and visualizing those distributions.
\secref{sec:discrete-fit} presents theory and visualization techniques
related to fitting these distributions to empirical data.
In some cases, we may not know \emph{which} discrete distribution
should be fit to a given \Dset;  \secref{sec:discrete-Ord}
describes a simple graphical method designed to determine an appropriate
distribution type.
A more robust graphical method for diagnosing whether a given data
set follows the Poisson distribution is illustrated in \secref{sec:discrete-Poissonness}.
It turns out that the the discrete distributions described here
are members of a more general, parametric family, the \emph{power series},
permitting these
techniques to be applied to all of them.
A number of SAS macros to simplify the fitting and graphing of discrete
distributions are presented throughout the chapter.
  
The tables described in \exref{ex:horskick1}--\exref{ex:butterfly} illustrate several discrete data sets. For data such as these,
we can fit various discrete distributions and test hypotheses that
the fit is reasonably close.
However, rather than simply summarizing the goodness-of-fit in a
single number, we learn more from well-chosen graphical displays.

\begin{Example}[horskick1]{Death by horse kick}
One of the oldest and best known examples of a Poisson distribution
is the data from
\citet{Bortkiewicz:98} on deaths of soldiers in the Prussian
army from kicks by horses and mules, shown in \tabref{tab:horskick}.
von Bortkiewicz tabulated the number of soldiers in each of
14 army corps in the 20 years from 1875-1894
who died after being kicked by a horse
\citep[p. 18]{AndrewsHerzberg:85}.
\tabref{tab:horskick} shows the data used by
\citet{Fisher:25} for 10 of these
army corps, summed over 20 years, giving 200
`corps-year' observations.  In 109 corps-years,
no deaths occurred; 65 corps-years had one death, etc.
The data set is given more fully in \datref{dat:vonbort}.
The distribution is plotted in \figref{fig:poischart1}.
\input{ch2/tab/horskick}
\end{Example}

\begin{Example}[madison1]{Federalist papers}
In 1787--88, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison
wrote a series of newspaper essays to persuade the voters of
New York State to ratify the U.S. Constitution.
The essays were titled \emph{The Federalist Papers}
and all were signed with the pseudonym ``Publius.''  Of the 77 papers published,
the author(s) of 65 are known, but \emph{both}
Hamilton and Madison later claimed sole authorship of the remaining 12.
\citet{MostellerWallace:84}
investigated the use of statistical methods to identify authors of
disputed works based on the frequency distributions of certain key
function words, and concluded that Madison had indeed authored the
12 disputed papers.  

\tabref{tab:madison} shows the distribution of the occurrence of one of
these ``marker'' words, 
the
word \emph{may} in 262 blocks of text (each about 200 words long)
from issues of the \emph{Federalist Papers} and other essays known
to be written by James Madison.  In 156 blocks, the word \emph{may}
did not occur; it occurred once in 63 blocks, etc.  The distribution
is plotted in \figref{fig:poischart2}.

\input{ch2/tab/madison}

 \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Note that the distributions of these data sets in \figref{fig:poischart1}
and \figref{fig:poischart2} are superficially similar in shape:
both have their mode at $k=0$ and frequencies $n_k$ which steadily
decline as $k$ increases.
Nevertheless, it turns out, the Horse Kick data is reasonably well-described by
a Poisson distribution, but the Madison data is not (Mosteller
and Wallace concluded that a negative binomial distribution provides
a better fit).
\end{Example}

Several other discrete distributions are illustrated by the
following examples.

\begin{Example}[queues]{Women in queues}
\citet{JinkinsonSlater:81,HoaglinTukey:85}
give the frequency distribution of the number of females observed in
queues of length 10 in a London Underground station.
If it is assumed that people line up independently, and that
men and women are equally likely to be found in a queue
(not necessarily reasonable assumptions),
then the number of women out of 10
would have a (symmetric) binomial distribution with parameters $N=10$ and
$p=\frac12$.
The frequency distribution, shown in \tabref{tab:queues},
appears systematically asymmetric, as we can see more clearly in
a histogram, \figref{fig:poischart3}.
However, there is no real reason to expect that males and females are
equally likely to be found in queues in the London underground,
so we may be interested in estimating $p$ from the data
and determining if a binomial distribution fits.

\begin{Example}[dice]{Weldon's dice}
Common examples of binomial distributions involve tossing coins
or dice.
Perhaps the most industrious dice-tosser of all times,
Weldon tallied the results of throwing 12 dice 26,306 times
(a task which presumably required a good deal of leisure time).
He reported his results in a letter to Francis Galton dated
February 2, 1894, in order
``to judge whether the differences between a series of group frequencies
and a theoretical law \dots were more than might be attributed
to the chance fluctuations of random sampling''
\citep{KempKemp:91}.
In his seminal paper,
\citet{Pearson:00} used Weldon's data to illustrate the \chisq{} goodness-of-fit test, as did
\citet[Table 5.1, p. 121]{KendallStuart:63}.  These data are
shown here as
\tabref{tab:dice},
in terms of the number of occurrences of either a 5 or
6 in the throw of 12 dice.
If the dice were all identical and perfectly fair (balanced), one would
expect that $p = \Pr\{5 \textrm{ or } 6\} = \frac13$
and the distribution of the number of 5 or 6 would be binomial.
A peculiar feature of these data
as presented by Kendall and Stuart (not uncommon in discrete distributions)
is that the frequencies of 10--12 successes
are lumped together.  This grouping must be taken into account in fitting
the distribution.  The distribution is shown in \figref{fig:dice}.

\end{Example}

\begin{Example}[butterfly]{Butterfly species in Malaya}
In studies of the diversity of animal species, individuals are
collected and classified by species.
The distribution of the number of species (types) where $k = 1, 2, \dots$
individuals (tokens) were collected forms a kind of type-token distribution.
An early example of this kind of distribution was presented by
\citet{Fisher-etal:43}.
\tabref{tab:butterfly} lists the number of individuals of each of
501 species of butterfly collected in Malaya.
There were thus 118 species for which just a single instance was found,
74 species for which two individuals were found,
down to 3 species for which 24 individuals were collected.
Fisher et-al.\  note however that the distribution was truncated
at $k = 24$.
Type-token distributions are often J-shaped, with a long upper tail,
as we see in \figref{fig:poischart4}.
