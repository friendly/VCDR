\begin{Example}[shakewds]{How many words did Shakespeare know?}
Statistical studies of the works of Shakespeare abound.  Perhaps the
most intriguing is a paper by \citet{EfronThisted:76}
which attempts to estimate the
number of words that Shakespeare knew, by 
analysis of the freqency distribution of words in Shakespeare's
known works.
From the concordance by \citet{Spevack:68}, these works comprise
884,647 words in total.  The number of word types, $n_k$, which occurred
exactly $k$ times is shown in \tabref{tab:shakewds} for values of
$k$ from 1--100, giving 30,688 distinct word types. In addition, there were 846 word types which appeared
more than 100 times, so the total number of words which actually
appear in Shapespeare's writings is 31,534.
