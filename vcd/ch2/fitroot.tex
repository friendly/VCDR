\subsection{The \macro{ROOTGRAM}}\label{discrete-root}
The \macro{ROOTGRAM} (\macref{mac:rootgram}) displays observed and fitted frequencies
for a \Dset\ in any of the forms shown in \figref{fig:madfit}.
The input \Dset\ is usually of the form of the output
\texttt{OUT=} \Dset\ produced by the \macro{GOODFIT}.

\begin{Example}[federalist2]{Federalist papers}
We have seen that the negative binomial produces a better fit to the
Federalist Papers data.  The hanging rootogram (\figref{fig:madfit5}),
produced by the statements below, is characteristic of a decent fit.
\begin{listing}
%include catdata(madison);
%goodfit(data=madison, var=count, freq=blocks, dist=negbin, out=fit2);
%rootgram(data=fit2, var=count, obs=blocks, btype=dev);
\end{listing}

\begin{Example}[saxony1]{Families in Saxony}
Geissler
(cited in \citet{SokalRholf:69}
and \citet{Lindsey:95})
tabulated a huge \Dset\ on sex distributions in families in Saxony
in the 19th century.  Included were $N=6115$ families with $n=12$ children,
which might reasonably be expected to follow a Bin(12,$p$) distribution.
The data are input and fit as shown below.
\input{ch2/sas/saxony}

The fitted distribution, using the estimated proportion of males,
$p = .5192$ is shown in \outref{out:saxony.1};
the goodness of fit tests shown in \outref{out:saxony.2}
indicate that the fit of the Binomial is not good.
The hanging rootogram in \figref{fig:saxony} shows why---%
there is a systematic pattern of deviations from the Binomial,
which produces fitted frequencies too high in the middle and too small
in the tails.
The lack of fit might be ascribed to violations of the assumptions---%
a constant probability of a male birth over a long time span
is a good possibility.
\footnote{\citet[p. 131]{Lindsey:95}
fits a double binomial model with one extra parameter,
and achieves a much better fit, but this too
shows significant lack of fit, not surprising considering the
enormous sample size.}
