\section{Polytomous response models}\label{sec:logist-poly}

When the response, $y$, takes on $m > 2$ discrete values, there are
several ways to model the response probabilities.  Let \(\pi_{ij} \equiv
\pi_j \,  ( \vec{x}_i )\) be the probability of response j for case
or group i, given the predictors $\vec{x}_i$.
Because \(\sum_j \,  \pi_{ij} = 1\), only \(m - 1\) of
these probabilities are independent.

The simplest approach uses
the 
\glossterm{proportional odds model}, described in \secref{sec:ordinal}.
This model applies only when the response is ordinal,
\emph{and} an additional assumption
(the proportional odds assumption) holds.  
However, if the
response is purely nominal (e.g., vote Tory, Liberal, Reform, NDP),
or if the proportional odds assumption is untenable, another particularly
simple strategy is to fit separate models to a set of \(m - 1\)
\glossterm{nested dichotomies} derived from the polytomous response
(\secref{sec:nested}).
Both of these methods are handled by \PROC{LOGISTIC}.

A third strategy, described in \secref{sec:genlogit}, is to choose one
    response category (the last, say) as the ``base category'', and
    model the \glossterm{generalized logits} for each of categories
    \(j = 1, 2, \dots , (m - 1)\) compared to category m.  For a
    3-category response, e.g., there are 2 generalized logits,
     \(\logit_{i1}  = \log  ( { \pi_{i1} } /  { \pi_{i3} })\) and
     \(\logit_{i1}  = \log  ( { \pi_{i2} } /  { \pi_{i3} })\).
     These models can be fit using \PROC{CATMOD}.

\subsection{Nested dichotomies}\label{sec:nested}

Nested dichotomies are successive binary partitions of the response
categories into nested sets.  For the levels of
a factor in an ANOVA design, nested dichotomies correspond to
orthogonal contrasts (assuming equal $n$s).

For example, the response categories
\{1,2,3,4\} could be divided first as \{1,2\} vs. \{3,4\}, as shown in the
left side of \figref{fig:nested}.  Then these two
dichotomies could be divided as \{1\} vs. \{2\}, and \{3\} vs. \{4\}.
Alternatively, these response categories could be divided as shown in the
right side of \figref{fig:nested}: first, \{1\} vs.
\{2,3,4\}, then \{2\} vs \{3,4\}, and finally \{3\} vs. \{4\}.

\end{figure}

Then,
\begin{itemize}

\item Each dichotomy can be fit using the familiar binary-response
 logistic model, and,
\item When the dichotomies are nested, the \(m - 1\) models will be statistically independent, so
that likelihood-ratio \(G^2\) statistics for overall fit, and
Wald statistics for individual terms will be additive.
\end{itemize}
Thus, we can treat the set of \(m - 1\) models as a single model
for the polytomous response, although we fit them separately for
computational purposes.  This approach to polytomous responses
is described in more detail by \citet{Fox:97}.
