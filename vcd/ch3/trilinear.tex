\section{Trilinear plots}\label{sec:twoway-trilinear}
The \glossterm{trilinear plot}
(also called a \emph{ternary diagram} or \emph{trinomial plot})
is a specialized display for a 3-column \ctab{} or for
three variables whose relative proportions are to be displayed.
Individuals may be assigned to one of three diagnostic categories,
for example, or a chemical process may yield three constituents
in varying proportions, or we may look at the division of votes
among three parties in a parliamentary election.
This display is useful, therefore, for both frequencies
and proportions.
Trilinear plots are featured prominently in \citet{Aitchison:86},
who describes statistical models for this type of
\glossterm{compositional data}.  \citet{Upton:76,Upton:94}
uses them in detailed analyses of spatial and temporal changes in
British general elections.
\citet{Wainer:96} reviews a variety of other uses of trilinear
plots and applies them to aid in understanding the distributions
of students achievement in the
National Assessment of Educational Progress,
making some aesthetic improvements to the traditional form of these
plots along the way.

A trilinear plot displays each observation as a point inside
an equilateral triangle whose coordinate corresponds to the
relative proportions in each column.
The three vertices represent the three extremes when 100\%
occurs in one of the three columns; a point in the exact
center corresponds to equal proportions of $\frac13$ in
all three columns.  For instance, \figref{fig:tripdemo2}
shows how three points whose compositions of three variables,
A, B, and C are shown as annotations.
Note that each apex corresponds to 100\% of the labeled
variable, and the percentage of this variable decrease
linearly along a line to the midpoint of the opposite
baseline.
The grid lines in the figure show the percentage value along
each axis.

The construction of trilinear plots is described in detail
by \citet{FedenczukBercov:91}.
Briefly, let $P(a, b, c)$ represent the three components  normalized so
that $a + b + c = 1.0$.
If the apex corresponding to Point A in \figref{fig:tripdemo2}
is given $(x, y)$ coordinates of $(x_A, y_A) = (0, 0)$,
and those at apex B are $(x_B, y_B) = (100, 0)$,
then the coordinates of apex C are $(x_C, y_C) = (50, 50\sqrt{3})$.
The coordinates $(x_P, y_P)$  of $P$ are then calculated as
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_P & = & c \: y_C \\
x_P & = & y_P \left( \frac{y_C - y_B}{x_C - x_B} \right)
+ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} y_C (1 - a) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The figures shown here are produced using the \macro{TRIPLOT},
which is listed in \macref{mac:triplot}.

\begin{Example}[arthrit5]{Arthritis treatment}
%\example{Arthritis treatment}
In the Arthritis treatment data, our interest is focused on the
relative numbers of individuals in the three outcome categories
for the four groups defined by the combinations of Treatment
and Sex.

\figref{fig:arthtri} shows clearly that both groups given the
active treatment result in greater proportions of successful
outcomes (some or marked improvement) than do the placebo
groups.
In addition, regardless of treatment, females show greater
proportions of successful outcomes than do males.

\end{figure}

\figref{fig:arthtri} is produced using the \macro{TRIPLOT}
as follows.  For convenience in identifying the treatment-sex combinations,
these two variables are combined into a single \texttt{GROUP} variable,
used as the value of the \texttt{CLASS=} parameter in the macro call.

\begin{Example}[baseball]{Baseball fielding}
The \emph{Baseball \Dset} from \SSSGref{A2.3}
includes data on the salaries and batting and fielding performance of 322 major league in the 1986 baseball season.
Fielding performance includes the numbers of Errors,
Putouts and Assists made by each player.
(Putouts occur when a fielder causes an opposing player to be tagged or forced out;
assists are credited to other fielders involved in making that
putout.)

\figref{fig:basetri} shows a triplot for this data.
Because of the large number of observations in the \Dset,
the mean number of putouts, assists and errors was calculated for each team
and for each position, giving a reduced \Dset\ of 169 observations.%
\footnote{Putouts and assists also occur far more often than errors,
so the values of each variable were also first scaled to a common range.}
These observations are graphed in \figref{fig:basetri} coding the
player's position by the plotting symbol.

  \caption[Trilinear plot for baseball data]{Trilinear plot for baseball fielding data}\label{fig:basetri}
\end{figure}

It may be seen that two main types of
players may be distinguished by their relative proportions of
putouts and assists: Outfielders, catchers and first basemen
contribute to defense primarily in making putouts; other infielders
primarily make assists.  The utility players (UT) play in a variety
of positions and are scattered throughout the plot.
Beyond this main observation, you can also see that outfielders and
third basemen tend to make more errors than players in other positions.
