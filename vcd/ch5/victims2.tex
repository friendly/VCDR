\begin{Example}[victims2]{Repeat victimization}
\exref{ex:victims} presented mosaic displays for the data on repeat
victimization.
Here we examine \CA\ results and also illustrate how to customize the
displays created by the \macro{CORRESP}.
The following lines create the \Dset\ \pname{VICTIMS} in contingency table
form, where the columns represent the first victimization and the
rows are the second victimization.
\begin{listing}

Because the rows and columns refer to the same crimes
(and because the points for the same crime occupy similar positions
in the \CA\ map), we wish to label each crime just once, and
connect the two points for each crime by a line, as shown in \figref{fig:corresp5a}.

\end{figure}

The following lines use the \macro{CORRESP} with the \mparm{GPLOT=NO}{CORRESP},
so that no plot is produced;  however, the macro still creates the \ODS\ \pname{COORD} and the \ADS\ \pname{LABEL} used in the \proc{GPLOT}
to produce a customized plot.
Lines joining points for the same crime are created from the \pname{COORD}
\Dset, after sorting by \verb|upcase(_name_)|.
The (properly equated) \pname{AXIS} statements are constructed automatically by the
\macro{EQUATE}.%
\footnote{The \macro{EQUATE} is called by \texttt{\%CORRESP}
when the \mparm{HAXIS}{CORRESP} and the
\mparm{VAXIS}{CORRESP} are not specified in the macro call.}
\input{ch5/sas/corresp5a}

In \figref{fig:corresp5a} it may be seen that most of the points are
extremely close for the first and second occurrence of a crime,  indicating
that the row profile for a crime is very similar to its corresponding column
profile, with Rape and Pick Pocket as exceptions.
The first dimension appears to contrast crimes against the person (left) with
crimes against property (right), and it may be that the second dimension
represents degree of violence associated with each crime.
The latter interpretation is consistent with the movement of Rape towards
a higher position and Pick Pocket towards a lower one on this dimension.
