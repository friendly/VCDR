It is often important in displaying results from a data analysis to  equate the axes in the plot so that a
centimeter on the horizontal  axis represents the same data range as a centimeter on the vertical  axis.
When the axes are equated, distances and angles are  correctly presented in the plot.
The easiest way to equate axes in  PROC PLOT is by specifying three options:  HAXIS=, VAXIS=, and   VTOH=.
The VTOH= option tries to equate distances between ticks,  so specify the same tick increment for both axes.
It is now  possible to specify ticks without specifying the minima and maxima.
Specify HAXIS=BY n and VAXIS=BY n, where n is the tick increment.

Different VTOH= values may be needed for different output devices,  and different tick increments
may be needed for different data  sets.  PROC PLOT will often do a better job of equating the axes if
relatively large tick increments are chosen.
Sometimes PLOT will decide that it cannot simultaneously use the
values specified for all three options and change one or more of  the specified values,
so always check to make sure PLOT did in fact  equate the axes.
Example:

      PROC PLOT VTOH=2;
         PLOT Y * X = '*' $ IDVAR / HAXIS=BY 1 VAXIS=BY 1;
         RUN;


When output characters are twice as high as wide and PLOT is able  to use a tick increment of one for both axes,
the axes will be  equated so that a centimeter on the horizontal axis represents the  same data range as a
centimeter on the vertical axis.
