\begin{Example}[marital3]{Marital status and pre- and extramarital sex}
The data on the relation between marital status and reported
premarital and extramarital sex was explored earlier using mosaic
displays in \exref{ex:marital1} and \exref{ex:marital2}.

The $2\times 2 \times 2 \times 2$ table in frequency form can be
analyzed as shown below, where the classification variables are
\pname{GENDER}, \pname{PRE}, \pname{EXTRA}, and \pname{MARITAL}.

\begin{listing}
data marital;
   input gender $ pre $ extra $ @;
    pre = 'Pre:' || pre;
    extra = 'X:' || extra;
   marital='Divorced';  input freq @;  output;
   marital='Married';   input freq @;  output;
datalines;
Women  Yes  Yes   17   4
Women  Yes  No    54  25
Women  No   Yes   36   4
Women  No   No   214 322
Men    Yes  Yes   28  11
Men    Yes  No    60  42
Men    No   Yes   17   4
Men    No   No    68 130

proc corresp data=marital mca outc=coords;
    weight freq;
    tables gender pre extra marital;

\end{listing}
The same analysis, with the addition of the 2D plot of
category scores, would be produced by the \macro{CORRESP},
\begin{listing}
%corresp(data=marital, tables=gender pre extra marital, weight=freq, 
   options=mca short, interp=vec, inc=1, pos=-, symbols=dot);
\end{listing}

An enhanced version%
\footnote{The size of the bubble symbol surrounding each point is proportional
to the quality of the representation in two dimensions.}
of this plot is shown in \figref{fig:mcamarital1}.
The principal inertias, listed in \outref{out:maritalmca1}, again suggest
that two dimensions are sufficient for this \Dset.
The positions of the category points on Dimension 1 suggest that Women
are less likely to have had pre-marital and extra-marital sex
and that still being married is associated with the absence of pre- and extra-marital sex.

Although two dimensions are probably sufficient for interpreting these
data, we illustrate three-dimensional plots briefly.
When you specify the parameter \pname{DIM=3},
the \macro{CORRESP} produces a coordinates \Dset\ and an \ADS\
with three dimensions.%
\footnote{The first two dimensions are identical to the 2D solution,
because of the nested nature of CA and MCA solutions.}
It also produces a labeled \PROC{G3D} scatter plot.
However, the \pname{G3D} procedure does not allow axes to be equated,
and it is usually necessary to experiment with the \pname{ROTATE}
and \pname{TILT} options to produce a reasonable display, so the plot
generated by the macro should be considered just a first approximation.

A three-dimensional MCA solution for the Marital status data is produced with
this statement:
\input{ch5/sas/mcamar1}  

To roughly equate the axes,
the initial plot (not shown) was modified by extending the plotting range
for all dimensions as shown below.   Some additional annotation steps
(not shown) produces \figref{fig:mcamarital2}.  Note that the projections
of the points on the Dim1--Dim2 plane is identical to the solution shown
in \figref{fig:mcamarital1}.
