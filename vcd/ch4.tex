Mosaic displays help to visualize the pattern of associations
among variables in two-way and larger tables.  Extensions of
this technique can reveal partial associations, marginal associations,
and shed light on the structure of \loglin\ models themselves.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:mosaic-intro}
\input{ch4/boxes}
In \chref{ch:twoway}, I described a variety of graphical techniques
for visualizing the pattern of association in simple \ctabs{}.
These methods tend to be specialized, however, for particular
shapes and sizes of tables: two-way (sieve diagram),
$2 \times 2$ tables (fourfold display), $r \times 3$ tables
(trilinear plots), and so on.

This chapter describes the
\glossterm{mosaic display},
 a graphical method that displays the
frequencies in a \ctab{} by a collection of rectangular ``tiles''
whose size (area) is proportional to the cell frequency.
In this respect, the mosaic display is similar to the sieve diagram.
The mosaic display, however,

\begin{itemize}
\item generalizes readily to n-way tables.  One can usefully examine
3-way, 4-way and even larger tables, subject, of course, to the limitations
of resolution in any graph;
\item displays the deviations (residuals) from a given log-linear model
which has been fit to the table;
\item provides a method for fitting a series of sequential log-linear
models to the various marginal totals of an n-way table; and
\item can be used to illustrate the relations among variables which
are fitted by various log-linear models.
\end{itemize}
