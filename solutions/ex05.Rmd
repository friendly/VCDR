[lab:mosaic-criminal] The data set criminal in the package logmult gives
the $4 \times 5$ table below of the number of men aged 15–19 charged
with a criminal case for whom charges were dropped in Denmark from
1955–1958. <<criminal-data\>\>= data("criminal", package = "logmult")
criminal @

Use loglm to test whether there is an association between Year and Age.
Is there evidence that dropping of charges in relation to age changed
over the years recorded here?

Use mosaic with the option shade=TRUE to display the pattern of signs
and magnitudes of the residuals. Compare this with the result of mosaic
using “Friendly shading,” from the option gp=shading\_Friendly. Describe
verbally what you see in each regarding the pattern of association in
this table.

[lab:mosaic-crash] The data set AirCrash in vcdExtra gives a database of
all crashes of commercial airplanes between 1993–2015, classified by
Phase of the flight and Cause of the crash. How can you best show is the
nature of the association between these variables in a mosaic plot?
Start by making a frequency table, aircrash.tab: <<eval=FALSE\>\>=
data("AirCrash", package = "vcdExtra") aircrash.tab <- xtabs(  Phase +
Cause, data = AirCrash) @

Make a default mosaic display of the data with shade=TRUE and interpret
the pattern of the high-frequency cells.

The default plot has overlapping labels due to the uneven marginal
frequencies relative to the lengths of the category labels. Experiment
with some of the labeling\_args options (abbreviate, rot\_labels, etc.)
to see if you can make the plot more readable. *Hint*: a variety of
these are illustrated in §4.1 of vignette("strucplot")

The levels of Phase and Cause are ordered alphabetically (because they
are factors). Experiment with other orderings of the rows/columns to
make interpretation clearer, e.g., ordering Phase temporally or ordering
both factors by their marginal frequency.

The Lahman contains comprehensive data on baseball statistics for Major
League Baseball from 1871 through 2012. For all players, the Master
table records the handedness of players, in terms of throwing (L, R) and
batting (B, L, R), where B indicates “both.” The table below was
generated using the following code: <<basehands, eval=FALSE\>\>=
library(Lahman) data("Master", package = "Lahman") basehands <-
with(Master, table(throws, bats)) @

[ht]

r|rrr

& 3cBats\
Throws & B & L & R\
L & 177 & 2640 & 527\
R & 924 & 1962 & 10442\

Use the code above, or else enter these data into a frequency table in .

Construct mosaic displays showing the relation of batting and throwing
handedness, split first by batting and then by throwing.

From these displays, what can be said about players who throw with their
left or right hands in terms of their batting handedness?

A related analysis concerns differences in throwing handedness among
baseball players according to the fielding position they play. The
following code calculates such a frequency table.

<<throwpos\>\>= library(Lahman) MasterFielding <-
data.frame(merge(Master, Fielding, by = "playerID")) throwPOS <-
with(MasterFielding, table(POS, throws)) @

Make a mosaic display of throwing hand vs. fielding position.

Calculate the percentage of players throwing left-handed by position.
Make a sensible graph of this data.

Re-do the mosaic display with the positions sorted by percentage of
left-handers.

Is there anything you can say about positions that have very few
left-handed players?

For the Bartlett data described in ex:bartlett, fit the model of no
three-way association, $H_4$ in tab:hyp3way.

Summarize the goodness of fit for this model, and compare to simpler
models that omit one or more of the two-way terms.

Use a mosaic-like display to show the lack of fit for this model.

Red core disease, caused by a fungus, is not something you want if you
are a strawberry. The data set jansen.strawberry from the agridat gives
a frequency data frame of counts of damage from this fungus from a field
experiment reported by \cite{Jansen:1990}. See the help file for
details. The following lines create a $3 \times 4 \times 3$ table of
crossings of 3 male parents with 4 (different) female parents, recording
the number of plants in four blocks of 9 or 10 plants each showing red
core disease in three ordered categories, C1, C2, or C3. <<strawberry,
eval=FALSE\>\>= data("jansen.strawberry", package = "agridat")

dat <- jansen.strawberry dat <- transform(dat, category =
ordered(category, levels = c(’C1’,’C2’,’C3’)))
levels(dat$male) <- paste0("M", 1:3)
levels(dat$female) <- paste0("F", 1:4)

jansen.tab <- xtabs(count   male + female + category, data = dat)
names(dimnames(jansen.tab)) <- c("Male parent", "Female parent",
"Disease category") ftable(jansen.tab) @

Use pairs(jansen.tab, shade=TRUE) to display the pairwise associations
among the three variables. Describe how disease category appears to vary
with male and female parent. Why is there no apparent association
between male and female parent?

As illustrated in fig:HE-fill, use mosaic to prepare a 3-way mosaic plot
with the tiles colored in increasing shades of some color according to
disease category. Describe the pattern of category C3 in relation to
male and female parent. (Hint: the highlighting arguments are useful
here.)

With category as the response variable, the minimal model for
association is MF,C, or `~ 1*2 + 3`. Fit this model using loglm and
display the residuals from this model with mosaic. Describe the pattern
of lack of fit of this model.

The data set caith in MASS gives another classic $4 \times 5$ table
tabulating hair color and eye color, this for people in Caithness,
Scotland, originally from \citet{Fisher:1940}. The data is stored as a
data frame of cell frequencies, whose rows are eye colors and whose
columns are hair colors. <<caith-data\>\>= data("caith", package =
"MASS") caith @

The loglm and mosaic functions don’t understand data in this format, so
use Caith <- as.matrix(caith) to convert to array form. Examine the
result, and use names(dimnames(Caith))<-c() to assign appropriate names
to the row and column dimensions.

Fit the model of independence to the resulting matrix using loglm.

Calculate and display the residuals for this model.

Create a mosaic display for this data.

The HairEyePlace data in vcdExtra gives similar data on hair color and
eye color, for both Caithness and Aberdeen as a $4 \times 5 \times 2$
table.

Prepare separate mosaic displays, one for each of Caithness and
Aberdeen. Comment on any difference in the pattern of residuals.

Construct conditional mosaic plots, using the formula
`~ Hair + Eye | Place` and both mosaic and cotabplot. It is probably
more useful here to suppress the legend in these plots. Comment on the
difference in what is shown in the two displays.

[lab:mosaic-accident] \citet[pp. 30--31]{Bertin:83} used a 4-way table
of frequencies of traffic accident victims in France in 1958 to
illustrate his scheme for classifying data sets by numerous variables,
each of which could have various types and could be assigned to various
visual attributes. His data are contained in Accident in vcdExtra, a
frequency data frame representing his $5 \times 2 \times 4 \times 2$
table of the variables age, result (died or injured), mode of
transportation, and gender. <<accident-data2\>\>= data("Accident",
package = "vcdExtra") str(Accident, vec.len=2) @

Use loglm to fit the model of mutual independence,
`Freq ~ age+mode+gender+result` to this data set.

Use mosaic to produce an interpretable mosaic plot of the associations
among all variables under the model of mutual independence. Try
different orders of the variables in the mosaic. (*Hint*: the abbreviate
component of the labeling\_args argument to mosaic will be useful to
avoid some overlap of the category labels.)

Treat result ("Died" vs. "Injured") as the response variable, and fit
the model `Freq ~ age*mode*gender + result` that asserts independence of
result from all others jointly.

Construct a mosaic display for the residual associations in this model.
Which combinations of the predictor factors are more likely to result in
death?

[lab:mosaic-vietnam]The data set Vietnam in vcdExtra gives a
$2 \times 5 \times 4$ contingency table in frequency form reflecting a
survey of student opinion on the Vietnam War at the University of North
Carolina in May 1967. The table variables are sex, year in school, and
response, which has categories: (A) Defeat North Vietnam by widespread
bombing and land invasion; (B) Maintain the present policy; (C)
De-escalate military activity, stop bombing and begin negotiations; (D)
Withdraw military forces immediately. How does the chosen response vary
with sex and year? <<accident-data\>\>= data("Vietnam", package =
"vcdExtra") str(Vietnam) @

With response (R) as the outcome variable and year (Y) and sex (S) as
predictors, the minimal baseline model is the model of joint
independence, R,YS. Fit this model, and display it in a mosaic plot.

Construct conditional mosaic plots of the response versus year
separately for males and females. Describe the associations seen here.

Follow the methods shown in ex:employ to fit separate models of
independence for the levels of sex, and the model of conditional
independence, $R \perp Y \given S$. Verify that the decomposition of
$\GSQ$ in eq:partial1 holds for these models.

Construct a useful 3-way mosaic plot of the data for the model of
conditional independence.

Consider the models for 4-way tables shown in tab:seqmodels.

For each model, give an independence interpretation. For example, the
model of mutual independence corresponds to $A \perp B \perp C \perp D$.

Use the functions shown in the table together with loglin2formula to
print the corresponding model formulas for each.

[lab:mosaic-titanic] The dataset Titanic classifies the 2,201 pasengers
and crew of the *Titanic* by Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, Crew), Sex, Age, and
Survived. Treating Survived as the response variable,

Fit and display a mosaic plot for the baseline model of joint
independence, CGA,S. Describe the remaining pattern of associations.

Do the same for a “main effects” model that allows two-way associations
between each of C, G, and A with S.

What three-way association term should be added to this model to allow
for greater survival among women and children? Does this give an
acceptable fit?

Test and display models that allow additional three-way associations
until you obtain a reasonable fit.
