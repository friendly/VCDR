## Build HTML from Markdown

The `index.html` file was generated using the following code from the markdown file:

```
pandoc index.md -o index.html
```

This is just an simple example with `pandoc`. Feel free to create other HTML files whatever way you want (e.g., via some Adobe product, text editor, or whatever). Otherwise, markdown with `pandoc` could suffice and be linked with some CSS template.
