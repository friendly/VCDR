The analysis of two-way frequency tables concerns the association
between two variables.  A variety of specialized graphical
displays help us to visualize the pattern of association,
using area of some region to represent the frequency in a cell.
Some of these methods are focused
on visualizing an odds ratio (for $2 \times 2$ tables), or the general
pattern of association, or the agreement between row and column
categories in square tables.}
