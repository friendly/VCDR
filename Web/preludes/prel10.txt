Loglinear models have special forms to represent additional structure in the
variables in contingency tables.  Models for ordinal factors allow a more
parsimonious description of associations.  Models for square tables
allow a wide range of specific models for the relationship between
variables with the same categories.  Another extended class of
models arise when there are two or more response variables.
