<div class="chapterprelude">
This chapter extends the model-building approach to \loglin and logit
models. These comprise another special case of generalized linear models
designed for \ctabs of frequencies.  They
are most easily interpreted through
visualizations, including mosaic displays and effect plots of associated
logit models.
