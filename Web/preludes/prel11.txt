<div class="chapterprelude">
Generalized linear models extend the familiar linear models of
regression and ANOVA to
include counted data, frequencies, and other data for which the
assumptions of independent normal errors are not reasonable.
We rely on the analogies between ordinary and generalized linear
models (GLMs) to develop visualization methods to explore the data,
display the fitted relationships, and check model assumptions.
The main focus of this chapter is on models for count data.
