This chapter introduces the modeling framework for categorical data in the simple
situation where we have a categorical response variable, often binary, and one or
more explanatory variables. A fitted model provides both statistical
inference and prediction, accompanied by measures of uncertainty.
Data visualization methods for discrete response data must often rely
on smoothing techniques, including both direct, non-parametric smoothing
and the implicit smoothing that results from a fitted parametric model.
Diagnostic plots help us to detect influential observations that may distort
our results.
