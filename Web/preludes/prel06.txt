Correspondence analysis provides visualizations of associations in a two-way \ctab
in a small number of dimensions.
Multiple correspondence analysis extends this technique to \nway\
tables.  Other graphical methods, including mosaic matrices and biplots,
provide complementary views of \loglin models for two-way and \nway
\ctabs, but \ca methods are particularly useful for a simple visual analysis.
