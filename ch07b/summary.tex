\begin{itemize}
\item Polytomous responses may be handled in several ways as extensions of binary
logistic regression.  These methods require different fitting functions in \R,
however the graphical methods for plotting results are relatively straight-forward
extensions of those used for binary responses.
%\begin{seriate}
 \item The \emph{proportional odds model} (\secref{sec:ordinal}) is simple and convenient, but its validity
depends
on an assumption of equal slopes for adjacent-category logits.
 \item \emph{Nested dichotomies} (\secref{sec:nested}) among the response categories give a set of models
which may be regarded as a single, combined model for the polytomous
response.
 \item \emph{Generalized logit models} (\secref{sec:genlogit})
 may be used to construct models comparing any pair of categories.
