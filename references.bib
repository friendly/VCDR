  to Geissler's data on the sex ratio in human families of from 2 to 12
  children. It is concluded that p, the probability of a birth being male,
  varies between families of the same size, having a variance of about 0–0025
  amongst a complete cross-section of a nineteenth-century German population,
  and that there is no evidence for the existence of parents only capable of
  producing unisexual families. Assuming that p varies within a family, the
  apparent anomalies would appear to be explicable. The critical conclusions of
  Lancaster regarding the reliability of Geissler's data are briefly examined.
  In an appendix, the derivation of the posterior probability distribution of p
  for a couple with a known number of boys and girls is given.}

  abstract = {This article develops a generalization of the scatterplot matrix
  based on the recognition that most datasets include both categorical and
  quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure
  important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but
  coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of
  paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot,
  fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two
  categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram,
  or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A
  traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical
  variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary
  statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example.
  By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure
  in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of
  exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations
  of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for
  this article are available online on the journal web site.}

  travelled an untested route between Fort Bridger, Wyoming, and the Humboldt
  River, Nevada. As a result of delays caused by this choice, they became
  stranded by heavy snows on the east flank of the Sierra Nevada. By the time
  the last member of the party was rescued, 40 had died. Analysis of the
  pattern of deaths among the Donners shows that survivorship within the party
  was mediated almost entirely by three factors: age, sex, and the size of the
  kin group with which each member travelled. The differential fate of the
  members of the Donner Party lends strong support to the argument that females
  are better able than males to withstand conditions marked by famine and
  extreme cold.}

  popular deletion measure of influence of individual data cases in linear
  regression. Masking is broadly concerned with the limitations imposed by the
  use of individual cases. Two specific views are drawn from quotations: the
  first is associated with the established idea of joint influence, i.e. the
  deletion of two or more cases simultaneously, and the second is conditional
  influence, i.e. the calculation of Cook's distance before and after the
  deletion of other cases. Attention is mainly focused on pairs of already
  identified cases. Intuitive understanding is obtained via explicit general
  forms for joint and conditional Cook's distance influence with pairs of
  cases; especially tractable results are obtained for replicate and opposite
  explanatory pairs, and for multiples of individual cases of opposite pairs.
  The noteworthy effects possible in joint influence are described as reducing,
  enhancing and swamping; in conditional influence, interesting effects are
  described as masking and boosting. Thus only in connection with one effect in
  conditional influence is the term masking used. The work is illustrated on
  one constructed and one reported data set.}

  sets was collected in Saxony in the 19th century by Geissler. The data
  contain the sizes of families, with the sex of all children, at the time of
  registration of the birth of a child. These data are reanalysed to determine
  how the probability for each sex changes with family size. Three models for
  overdispersion are fitted: the beta–binomial model of Skellam, the
  ‘multiplicative’ binomial model of Altham and the double-binomial model of
  Efron. For each distribution, both the probability and the dispersion
  parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously with family size according to
  two separate regression equations. A finite mixture model is also fitted. The
  models are fitted using non-linear Poisson regression. They are compared
  using direct likelihood methods based on the Akaike information criterion.
  The multiplicative and beta–binomial models provide similar fits,
  substantially better than that of the double-binomial model. All models show
  that both the probability that the child is a boy and the dispersion are
  greater in larger families. There is also some indication that a point
  probability mass is needed for families containing children uniquely of one
  sex.}
