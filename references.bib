  generalized for the setting where a two-way contingency table is available
  for two or more groups. Various restricted models can be used to examine
  possible sources of intergroup heterogeneity in the association. These
  sources pertain to heterogeneity in the intrinsic association and/or in the
  scores for the row and column variables. The importance of weights used to
  identify the row and column scores is emphasized. A classical set of data
  previously analyzed by many authors is used to illustrate the advantages of
  the models and methods developed here.}

  social science research. Local independence, expected value true scores, and
  nondeterministic functions of observed variables are three types of
  definitions for latent variables. These definitions are reviewed and an
  alternative “sample realizations” definition is presented. Another
  section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and
  other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then
  reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and
  logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response
  theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these
  application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well
  as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined
  and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of
  latent variables and their properties.}

  varies between families of the same size, having a variance of about 0?0025
  amongst a complete cross-section of a nineteenth-century German population,
  and that there is no evidence for the existence of parents only capable of
  producing unisexual families. Assuming that p varies within a family, the
  apparent anomalies would appear to be explicable. The critical conclusions of
  Lancaster regarding the reliability of Geissler's data are briefly examined.
  In an appendix, the derivation of the posterior probability distribution of p
  for a couple with a known number of boys and girls is given.}

  abstract = {This article develops a generalization of the scatterplot matrix
  based on the recognition that most datasets include both categorical and
  quantitative information. Traditional grids of scatterplots often obscure
  important features of the data when one or more variables are categorical but
  coded as numerical. The generalized pairs plot offers a range of displays of
  paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot,
  fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two
  categorical variables. A side-by-side boxplot, stripplot, faceted histogram,
  or density plot helps visualize a categorical and a quantitative variable. A
  traditional scatterplot is suitable for displaying a pair of numerical
  variables, but options also support density contours or annotating summary
  statistics such as the correlation and number of missing values, for example.
  By combining these, the generalized pairs plot may help to reveal structure
  in multivariate data that otherwise might go unnoticed in the process of
  exploratory data analysis. Two different R packages provide implementations
  of the generalized pairs plot, gpairs and GGally. Supplementary materials for
  this article are available online on the journal web site.}

  travelled an untested route between Fort Bridger, Wyoming, and the Humboldt
  River, Nevada. As a result of delays caused by this choice, they became
  stranded by heavy snows on the east flank of the Sierra Nevada. By the time
  the last member of the party was rescued, 40 had died. Analysis of the
  pattern of deaths among the Donners shows that survivorship within the party
  was mediated almost entirely by three factors: age, sex, and the size of the
  kin group with which each member travelled. The differential fate of the
  members of the Donner Party lends strong support to the argument that females
  are better able than males to withstand conditions marked by famine and
  extreme cold.}

  use of individual cases. Two specific views are drawn from quotations: the
  first is associated with the established idea of joint influence, i.e. the
  deletion of two or more cases simultaneously, and the second is conditional
  influence, i.e. the calculation of Cook's distance before and after the
  deletion of other cases. Attention is mainly focused on pairs of already
  identified cases. Intuitive understanding is obtained via explicit general
  forms for joint and conditional Cook's distance influence with pairs of
  cases; especially tractable results are obtained for replicate and opposite
  explanatory pairs, and for multiples of individual cases of opposite pairs.
  The noteworthy effects possible in joint influence are described as reducing,
  enhancing and swamping; in conditional influence, interesting effects are
  described as masking and boosting. Thus only in connection with one effect in
  conditional influence is the term masking used. The work is illustrated on
  one constructed and one reported data set.}

  contain the sizes of families, with the sex of all children, at the time of
  registration of the birth of a child. These data are reanalysed to determine
  how the probability for each sex changes with family size. Three models for
  overdispersion are fitted: the beta?binomial model of Skellam, the
  ?multiplicative? binomial model of Altham and the double-binomial model of
  Efron. For each distribution, both the probability and the dispersion
  parameters are allowed to vary simultaneously with family size according to
  two separate regression equations. A finite mixture model is also fitted. The
  models are fitted using non-linear Poisson regression. They are compared
  using direct likelihood methods based on the Akaike information criterion.
  The multiplicative and beta?binomial models provide similar fits,
  substantially better than that of the double-binomial model. All models show
  that both the probability that the child is a boy and the dispersion are
  greater in larger families. There is also some indication that a point
  probability mass is needed for families containing children uniquely of one
  sex.}

  opportunities for collaboration are significantly decreased by having young
  children. As a consequence, the presence of young children has an adverse,
  indirect effect on the productivity of female scientists during graduate
  study. This effect does not exist for males. In addition to differences in
  the process of collaboration, many small differences that disadvantage women
  and advantage men are found in the levels of resources affecting productivity
  and in the mechanisms by which resources are translated into productivity.
  The concentration of small disadvantages provides a further explanation of
  sex differences in productivity at the start of the career. Since early
  advantages and disadvantages have been found to accumulate, this article
  provides an essential first step in understanding sex differences in
  scientific productivity and position that emerge during the career.}

  distribution of parameter estimators. The bootstrap is a distribution-free
  method of assessing sampling variability based on resampling from the
  empirical distribution; the parametric bootstrap resamples from a fitted
  parametric model. However, if the parameters of the model are constrained,
  and the application of these constraints is a function of the realized
  sample, then the resampling distribution obtained from the parametric
  bootstrap may become badly biased and overdispersed. Here we discuss such
  problems in the context of estimating parameters from a bilinear model that
  incorporates the singular value decomposition (SVD) and in which the
  parameters are identified by the standard orthogonality relationships of the
  SVD. Possible effects of the SVD parameter identification are arbitrary
  changes in the sign of singular vectors, inversion of the order of singular
  values and rotation of the plotted co-ordinates. This paper proposes inverse
  transformation or 'filtering' techniques to avoid these problems. The ideas
  are illustrated by assessing the variability of the location of points in a
  principal co-ordinates diagram and in the marginal sampling distribution of
  singular values. An application to the analysis of a biological data set is
  described. In the discussion it is pointed out that several exploratory
  multivariate methods may benefit by using resampling with filtering.}

  selection. Using the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion to measure the
  closeness of a model to the truth, we propose simple likelihood-ratio based
  statistics for testing the null hypothesis that the competing models are
  equally close to the true data generating process against the alternative
  hypothesis that one model is closer. The tests are directional and are
  derived successively for the cases where the competing models are non-nested,
  overlapping, or nested and whether both, one, or neither is misspecified. As
  a prerequisite, we fully characterize the asymptotic distribution of the
  likelihood ratio statistic under the most general conditions. We show that it
  is a weighted sum of chi-square distribution or a normal distribution
  depending on whether the distributions in the competing models closest to the
  truth are observationally identical. We also propose a test of this latter
  condition.}

Incorporation of random effects into GLMs yields the class of models known as generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Random effects are typically included for analysis of clustered and/or longitudinal data to account for the correlation of the data. GLMMs are especially useful for analysis of correlated nonnormal data, and the term GLMMs often refers to models for these kinds of data.},
