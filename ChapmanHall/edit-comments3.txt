Comments and Notes on copy edit 2 of DDAR
=========================================

* In R code containing quoted strings, we are asked to put commas inside the quotes,
  e.g., \code{"M", "F"}., or \code{"None" < "Some" < "Marked"}.
  THIS IS WRONG in R, WE WILL NOT DO IT.  Syntactically, the " "s are part of string
  constants.

* In a few places, code in chunks or in output extends beyond the shaded boxes on the right.
  We have fixed what we could, but a few instances remain and will be left as is.
  This is particularly true in the output from some analyses produced directly by R, over which
  the only control is to make the font size smaller.
