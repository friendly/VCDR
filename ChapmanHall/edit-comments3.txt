Comments and Notes on copy edit 2 of DDAR
=========================================

* In R code containing quoted strings, we are asked to put commas inside the quotes,
  e.g., \code{"M", "F"}.
  THIS IS WRONG in R, WE WILL NOT DO IT.

* In a few places, code in chunks or in output extends beyond the shaded boxes on the right.
  We have fixed what we could, but a few instances remain and will be left as is.
