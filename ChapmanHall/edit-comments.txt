- serial commas: copy editor seems to use these religeously
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma

- et al. -- edit comments say set in roman, not ital.  
where is  this set in the  .bst?

Many writers use et al. correctly in terms of context but make italicization or punctuation errors.  
I have italicized et al. in this post because it’s a linguistic example (see section 4.21, p. 105).  
However, it should not be italicized when you are using it as part of a reference.  
We also see et al without the period at the end.  Because et al. is short for et alii (Latin for “and others”), 
the second word is actually an abbreviation and as such takes a period.
