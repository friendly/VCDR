Comments and Notes on copy edit of DDAR
-----------------------------


# General issues

* serial commas: copy editor seems to use these religiously.  My style has been not to use
the last comma before and/or, except when it might be ambiguous otherwise.
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma, where there seems to be quite divided opinion
on this style issue.
OK: I'll now use serial commas

* et al. -- edit comments say set in roman, not ital.
This is easy to change in the style file for the references, but I note that other (e.g., journal)
style files do it in ital.
DONE: added abbrvnat-apa-nourl-etal.bst to use roman for etal.  

One source says:
	Many writers use et al. correctly in terms of context but make italicization or punctuation errors.  
	I have italicized et al. in this post because it’s a linguistic example (see section 4.21, p. 105).  
	However, it should not be italicized when you are using it as part of a reference.  
	We also see et al without the period at the end.  Because et al. is short for et alii (Latin for “and others”), 
	the second word is actually an abbreviation and as such takes a period.

* punctuation inside quotes:  e.g., ``Male'', and ``Female.'' vs. ``Male,'' and ``Female.'' -- 
http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/quotes.asp says
Rule 3a. Periods and commas always go inside quotation marks. [American usage]
--  a rule that has the advantage of being far simpler than Britain's and the disadvantage of being far less logical.
OK: I'll now use punctuation inside quotes.

* figure placement:
In many places we are asked to move a figure/table to a different position on the page or to a different page.
In LaTeX, these are floats and LaTeX tries to balance placement against not leaving unnecessary white space.
But, in general, precise control of the placement of each float is difficult.  Perhaps a LaTeX person could look
over the float placement parameters we have used and recommend how to make this better.
(Filed as VCDR issue #42)
TODO: Marcus suggests using the float package, to gain [H] placement

*  [Fix art] and figure clipping:
In a number of figures, text labels are clipped to the plot region (e.g., Fig. 1.2)  
In other figures, text labels collide (Fig. 4.20)
We should try to fix these where possible (plot limits, font  size, etc.), but in many cases this will
be hard.

 

* blank pages -- The blank left page at the end of a chapter or part is asked to be compeletly blank (no page
number, no heading).  How to do this in LaTeX?
DONE: now use \usepackage{emptypage}

* Punctuation in display equations:
I use the following to add punctuation to display math, but the copy editors indicate to omit the space.
Perhaps, just make the space smaller.
\newcommand*{\comma}{\:\: ,}%                      punct after displaymath
\newcommand*{\period}{\:\: .}

* \subsubsection:
These are numbered in the text, e.g., 3.2.3.1 but don't appear in the TOC.  Should we use \subsubsection* instead?
