Comments and Notes on copy edit of DDAR
=======================================


# General issues: DONE
----------------------

* serial commas: DONE-- now use a, b, and c.

* et al. -- edit comments say set in roman, not ital.
DONE: added abbrvnat-apa-nourl-etal.bst to use roman for etal.  

* punctuation inside quotes:  e.g., ``Male'', and ``Female.'' vs. ``Male,'' and ``Female.'' -- DONE

* blank pages -- The blank left page at the end of a chapter or part is asked to be compeletly blank (no page
number, no heading). 
DONE: now use \usepackage{emptypage}

* figure placement:
In many places we are asked to move a figure/table to a different position on the page or to a different page.
However, in most cases this does not match the style of the book, which is to show figures produced by R code
inline, following the code.
DONE: We have looked through all such figures/tables, and moved some to the top or bottom of the page where this
is appropriate.  There may be one or two more that can be re-positioned in the next (final?) version.


* Punctuation in display equations:
DONE: Reduced the space in each, using latex macros \comma, \period


* \LLM{} macro generates unwanted spaces before punctuation.
DONE:  Now use \xspace in the definition of \LLM

* \pkg{} macro generates unwanted spaces before punctuation.
DONE: Removed unwanted ~ before \citex{}

* \subsubsection:
These are numbered in the text, e.g., 3.2.3.1 but don't appear in the TOC. There are 37 such cases. 
DONE: Our TOC style does not list \subsubsections, and I think this is appropriate for the book.
An alternative is to use a fancy TOC style, but we are not going to do this.

There are also 8 cases where \subsubsection* is used: 2 \subsubsection*{Remark}, 6 others
DONE: We left the Remarks as unnumbered, and converted the others to numbered \subsubsection.

# Not (yet) DONE or Questions
-----------------------------

*  [Fix art] and figure clipping:
In a number of figures, text labels are clipped to the plot region (e.g., Fig. 1.2)  
In other figures, text labels collide (Fig. 4.20)

We have this on a list of things to check in the next revision, however, in almost all cases
we have made reasonable attempts to do these as best as possible in R.
We could try to fix these where possible (plot limits, font  size, etc.), but in many cases this will
be hard, and WE WILL NOT engage in manually tweaking the image files.

* References:
For @incollection-like references, our .bst file generates \emph{booktitle}, (pp. pagenumbers).
Copy editor says to remove the comma.   Is this a requirement, or just a suggestion?

# RGB -> CMYK conversion
------------------------

It only occurred quite late in the writing that we were asked to supply the final PDF file using
only CMYK colors.  We have made every possible attempt to comply with this, by
(a) re-generating or converting all R figures using CMYK,
(b) using CMYK throughout the LaTeX for the book,
(c) manually converting RGB diagrams/figures to CMYK.

With the help of Marcus Fontaine, we ran an Adobe Preflight inspection.  The following issues remain:

* tikz figures:  On the inside title page, part pages, and chapter pages, we use LaTeX tikz figures
to provide a visual, drill-down contents.  It is a known issue that even with a CMYK setting, tikz
still generates RBG, or something that provokes complaints from Adobe.
