Comments and Notes on copy edit of DDAR
---------------------------------------


# General issues: DONE

* serial commas: DONE-- now use a, b, and c.

* et al. -- edit comments say set in roman, not ital.
DONE: added abbrvnat-apa-nourl-etal.bst to use roman for etal.  

* punctuation inside quotes:  e.g., ``Male'', and ``Female.'' vs. ``Male,'' and ``Female.'' -- DONE

* blank pages -- The blank left page at the end of a chapter or part is asked to be compeletly blank (no page
number, no heading). 
DONE: now use \usepackage{emptypage}

* figure placement:
In many places we are asked to move a figure/table to a different position on the page or to a different page.
However, in most cases this does not match the style of the book, which is to show figures produced by R code
inline, following the code.
We have looked through all such figures/tables, and moved some to the top or bottom of the page where this
is appropriate


* Punctuation in display equations:
I use the following to add punctuation to display math, but the copy editors indicate to omit the space.
DONE: Reduced the space in each


* \LLM{} macro generates unwanted spaces before punctuation.
DONE:  Now use \xspace in the definition of \LLM

* \pkg{} macro generates unwanted spaces before punctuation.
DONE: Removed unwanted ~ before \citex{}

# Not (yet) DONE

* \subsubsection:
These are numbered in the text, e.g., 3.2.3.1 but don't appear in the TOC. There are 37 such cases. 
Q: Should we use \subsubsection* instead?
There are also 8 cases where \subsubsection* is used: 2 \subsubsection{Remark}, 6 others 

*  [Fix art] and figure clipping:
In a number of figures, text labels are clipped to the plot region (e.g., Fig. 1.2)  
In other figures, text labels collide (Fig. 4.20)
We should try to fix these where possible (plot limits, font  size, etc.), but in many cases this will
be hard.

* References:
For @incollection-like references, the .bst file generates \emph{booktitle}, (pp. pagenumbers).
Copy editor says to remove the comma.
