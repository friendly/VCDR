Press-ready comments

Fig. 1.1, 1.9 and probably others:  in our submitted copy the two panels are sized appropriately and have the same
   top and bottom line.  In the press-ready copy, the two panels are offset vertically.

R code has disappeared in most code chunks, as if certain characters have been replaced by spaces.
  E.g., starting on p. 32 compare against the submitted .pdf file.  This seems to run throughout the
  entire book.
  
p 57 the chunk "xtable(HorseKicks)" is printed with a colored background an with some text in white.
	Same for the next three code chunks
