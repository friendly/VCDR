In the history of statistics and data analysis, developments of
statistical theory and statistical graphics have often gone hand-in-hand,
with advances in one or the other providing new insights, methods,
and ways of thinking about, describing and visualizing scientific data.

The starting point of modern statistical theory and statistical graphics
for \emph{quantitative data} can be arguably taken as the \citeyear{Galton:1886} paper 
by Francis Galton on hereditary stature---heights of children and their parents---that
established the idea of linear regression by showing a scatterplot of these variables
on which he had overlaid smoothed contour curves of roughly equal bivariate frequencies.
To his eye, these appeared remarkably as a set of concentric ellipses, with linear
relations for the means of $Y \given X$ and $X \given Y$.
His visual insight (described in \citet{FriendlyDenis:05:scat,Friendly-etal:ellipses:2013})
led to the theories of correlation, regression, ...
