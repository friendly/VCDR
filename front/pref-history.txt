\section*{Data analysis and graphics}

This book stems from the conviction that data analysis and statistical graphics
go hand-in-hand in the process of understanding and communicating statistical data.
Statistical summaries compress a data set into a few numbers, the result of an
hypothesis test, or coefficients in a fitted statistical model,
while graphical methods help to explore patterns and trends, see the unexpected,
identify problems in an analysis and communicate results and conclusions in 
principled and effective ways.

This interplay between analysis and visualization has long been a part of 
statistical practice for \emph{quantitative data}.  Indeed, the origin
of correlation, regression and linear models (regression, ANOVA) can
arguably be traced to Francis Galton's \citeyear{Galton:1886}
visual insight from a scatterplot of heights of children and their parents
on which he overlaid smoothed contour curves of roughly equal bivariate frequencies
and lines for the means of $Y \given X$ and $X \given Y$
(described in \citet{FriendlyDenis:05:scat,Friendly-etal:ellipses:2013}).

The analysis of discrete data is a much more recent arrival, beginning in the
1960s and giving rise to a few seminal books in the 1970s
\citep{Bishop-etal:75,Haberman:74, Goodman:1978,Fienberg:1980}.
\citet[\C 17]{Agresti:2013} presents a brief historical overview of the
development of these methods from their early roots around the beginning
of the 20^{th} Century.

Yet curiously, associated graphical methods for categorical data were 
much slower to develop. This began to change as it was recognized that
counts, frequencies and discrete variables required different
schemes for mapping numbers into useful visual representations \citep{Friendly:95,Friendly:97}.
The special nature of discrete variables
and frequency data vis-a-vis statistical graphics is now more widely accepted,
and many of these new graphical methods (e.g., mosaic displays, fourfold plots, diagnostic
plots for generalized linear models) have become, if not main stream, then at
least more widely used in research and teaching. 

Much of what had been developed through the 1990s for graphical methods for
discrete data was described in the book \emph{Visualizing Categorical Data}
\citep{Friendly:00:VCD} and was implemented in SAS software. 
Since that time,  
there has been considerable growth in both statistical methods for the
analysis of categorical data (e.g., generalized linear models, zero-inflation
models, mixed models for hierarchical and longitudinal data with discrete
outcomes), along with some new graphical methods for visualizing and
interpreting the results (3D mosaic plots, effect plots, diagnostic plots, etc.) 
The bulk of these developments have been implemented in \R, and the time is
right for an in-depth treatment of modern graphical methods for the analysis
of categorical data.
