In the history of statistics and data analysis, developments of
statistical theory and statistical graphics have often gone hand-in-hand,
with advances in one or the other providing new insights, methods,
and ways of thinking about, describing and visualizing scientific data.

The starting point of modern statistical theory and statistical graphics
for \emph{quantitative data} can be arguably taken as the \citeyear{Galton:1886} paper 
by Francis Galton on hereditary stature---heights of children and their parents---that
established the idea of linear regression by showing a scatterplot of these variables
on which he had overlaid contour curves of roughly equal bivariate frequencies.
