A visual display can force you to notice what you never expected to see.}{John W. Tukey \cite{Tukey:90}}

\epigraph{
Around the turn of the century, Karl Pearson, an almost elemental force for more and better statistical thought
in all areas of life, including with gusto, matters of social policy, was thinking and lecturing about 
graphical methods. But later in Pearson's life, and certainly in the careers of R. A. Fisher and the
other great statistical minds of the first half of the century, there was a falling away of interest in graphics
and an efflorescence  of devotion to analytical mathematical methods.
Indeed, for many years there was a contagious \emph{snobbery} against so unpopular, vulgar
and elementary a topic as graphics among academic statisticians and their students''}{\citep[p. 144, italics in original]{Kruskal:1978}}

\epigraph{Si la statistique  graphique, bien que  née d'hier, étend  chaque jour
son  domaine,  c'est  qu'elle remplace  avantageusement  les  longs tableaux  de
chiffres et qu'elle permet, non seulement d'embrasser d'un coup d'oeil la  série
des phénomènes, mais  encore d'en signaler  les rapports ou  les anomalies, d'en
trouver les causes, d'en dégager les lois.}{\'Emile Cheysson} 

\epigraph{If statistical graphics, although born just yesterday, extends its reach every day, it
is because it replaces long tables of numbers and it allows one not only to embrace
at glance the series of phenomena, but also to signal the correspondences or anomalies, to find
the causes, to identify the laws.}{\'Emile Cheysson, c. 1877}

\epigraph{
There is a magic in graphs. The profile of a curve reveals in
a flash a whole situation---the life history of an epidemic, a
panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs the mind,
awakens the imagination, convinces.

Graphs carry the message home. A universal language, graphs
convey information directly to the mind. Without complexity
there is imaged to the eye a magnitude to be remembered. Words
have wings, but graphs interpret. Graphs are pure quantity,
stripped of verbal sham, reduced to dimension, vivid, unescapable.

Graphs are all inclusive. No fact is too slight or too great to
plot to a scale suited to the eye. Graphs may record the path of an
ion or the orbit of the sun, the rise of a civilization, or the acceleration
of a bullet, the climate of a century or the varying pressure of
a heart beat, the growth of a business, or the nerve reactions of a
child.

The graphic art depicts magnitudes to the eye. It does more.
It compels the seeing of relations. We may portray by simple
graphic methods whole masses of intricate routine, the organization
of an enterprise, or the plan of a campaign. Graphs serve as storm
signals for the manager, statesman, engineer; as potent narratives
for the actuary, statist, naturalist; and as forceful engines of
research for science, technology and industry. They display
results. They disclose new facts and laws. They reveal discoveries
as the bud unfolds the flower.

The graphic language is modern. We are learning its alphabet.
That it will develop a lexicon and a literature marvelous for its
vividness and the variety of application is inevitable.
Graphs are dynamic, dramatic. They may epitomize an epoch,
each dot a fact, each slope an event, each curve a history. Wherever
there are data to record, inferences to draw, or facts to tell,
graphs furnish the unrivalled means whose power we are just beginning
to realize and to apply.

%% graph people vs. table people

\epigraph{Mr.  Funkhouser  has  made  an  extremely  interesting  and   valuable
contribution to  the history  of statistical  method. I  wish, however,  that he
could have added a  warning, supported by horrid  examples, of the evils  of the
graphical  method  unsupported   by  tables  of   figures.  Both  for   accurate
understanding, and particularly  to facilitate the  use of the  same material by
other people, it is essential that graphs should not be published by themselves,
but only when  supported by the  tables which lead  up to them.  It would be  an
exceedingly good rule to forbid in any scientific periodical the publication  of
graphs unsupported by  tables.}{John Maynard  Keynes, review of  Funkhouser for
The Economic Journal, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2224943}

%% Ellipses

\epigraph{
Mankind is not a circle with a single center but an ellipse with two focal points of which facts are one and ideas the other.}{Victor Hugo}

So, Fabricius, I already have this: that the most true path of the planet [Mars] is an ellipse, which Dürer also calls an oval, or certainly so close to an ellipse that the difference is insensible.
\u2014 Johannes Kepler

and must therefore have the best computing aids.}{Frank Yates, Sampling Methods for Censuses and Surveys, 1949}

\epigraph{Whatever relates to extent and quantity may be represented by
geometrical figures. Statistical projections which speak to the senses without
fatiguing the mind, possess the advantage of fixing the attention on a great
number of important facts.}{Alexander von Humboldt, \citeyear{Humboldt:1811a}, p. ciii}

\epigraph{I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the
wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the ``Law of Frequency of
Error.'' The law would
have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of
it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement, amidst the
wildest confusion. The
huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is
its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of
chaotic elements
are taken in hand and marshaled in the order of their magnitude, an
unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been
latent all along.}{Sir Francis Galton, \emph{Natural Inheritance}, London: Macmillan, 1889. Quoted in J. R. Newman (ed.) The World of Mathematics, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1956. p. 1482.}

\epigraph{In scientific thought we adopt the simplest theory which will explain
all the facts under consideration and enable us to predict new facts of
the same kind. The catch in
this criterion lies in the world "simplest." It is really an aesthetic
canon such as we find implicit in our criticisms of poetry or painting.
The layman finds such a law as
dx/dt = K(d^2x/dy^2) much less simple than "it oozes," of which it is
the mathematical statement. The physicist reverses this judgment, and
his statement is certainly
the more fruitful of the two, so far as prediction is concerned. It is,
however, a statement about something very unfamiliar to the plainman,
namely, the rate of change
of a rate of change.}{John Burdon Sanderson Haldane (1892-1964) Possible Worlds, 1927.}

\epigraph{We [he and Halmos] share a philosophy about linear algebra: we think
basis-free, we write basis-free, but when the chips are down we close
the office door and
compute with matrices like fury.}{Kaplansky, Irving \emph{Paul Halmos: Celebrating 50 Years of Mathematics}}

\epigraph{Oh, what a tangled web we weave,
When first we practice to deceive!}{Sir Walter Scott}

\epigraph{Practice is the best of all instructors.}{Publilius Syrus}

\epigraph{We should go to the masses and learn from them, synthesize their
experience into better, articulated principles and methods, then do
propaganda among the masses,
and call upon them to put these principles and methods into practice so
as to solve their problems and help them achieve liberation and
happiness.}{Chairman Mao Zedong, "Get Organized!" (November 29, 1943), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 158.}

\epigraph{This paper contains much that is new and much that is true.
Unfortunately, that which is true is not new

\epigraph{Winwood Reade is good upon the subject. He remarks that,
while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he

\epigraph{All models are wrong but some are useful.}{G. E. P. Box, 1979, p 201.}

History of this quote, from : http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:George_E._P._Box
As documented in: Box, George E. P., J. American Statistical Assoc., Vol 74, Number 365, March 1979, "Some Problems of Statistics of Everyday Life" [1]

An early quote of this idea was: "Models, of course, are never true, but fortunately it is only necessary that they be useful."

The quote "ALL MODELS ARE WRONG BUT SOME ARE USEFUL" is the title of a section of the paper Box, G.E.P. (1979) "Robustness in the strategy of scientific model building" in Robustness in Statistics (R.L. Launer and G.N. Wilkinson, Eds.), Academic Press. [2] But since this is the proceedings of a meeting that took place in April 11-12 1978 [3] , this is likely to be the original quote.


\epigraph{Whenever you can, count.}{Sir Francis Galton, quoted in Newman}

\epigraph{Some people hate the very name of statistics but I find them full of 
beauty and interest.  Whenever they are not brutalised, but 
delicately handled by the higher methods, and are warily interpreted, 
their power of dealing with complicated phenomena is extraordinary.}{Galton, \emph{Natual Inheritance}, 1889 p62}

\epigraph{[Statistics are] the only tools by which an opening may be cut 
through the formidable thicket of difficulties that bars the path of 
those who pursue the Science of Man.}{Galton, quoted in K. Pearson, \emph{The Life, Letters and Labours of Francis Galton} (London, 1914)}

\epigraph{It is difficult to understand why statisticians commonly limit their 
inquiries to Averages, and do not revel in more comprehensive views. 
Their souls seem as dull to the charm of variety as that of the 
native of our flat English counties, whose retrospect of Switzerland 
was that, if its mountains could be thrown into its lakes, two 
nuisances would be got rid of at once.}{Galton in \emph{Natural Inheritance}}

effort it takes to see them.}{George Polya}

\epigraph{A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a master of pattern.
 The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's, must be
beautiful; the ideas, like the colors or the words, must fit together in

gold behind the next tree, wouldn't you go and look?}{George Box}

\epigraph{Seek computer programs that allow you to do the thinking.}{George Box}

 When the ratio of the largest to smallest observation is large you should question whether the data are being analyzed in the right
 metric (transformation). (George Box)

 It is the data that are real (they actually happened!)

 The model is a hypothetical conjecture that might or might not summarize and/or explain important features of the data. (George Box)

\epigraph{When a law is contained in figures, it is buried like metal in an ore; it is necessary
to extract it.  This is the work of graphical representation. It points out the coincidences,
the relationships between phenomena, their anomalies, and we have seen what a powerful means of
control it puts in the hands of the statistician to verify new data, discover and correct errors
with which they have been stained.}{\'Emile Cheysson, \emph{Les m\'ethods de la statistique} (1890), 34-35.}


\epigraph{Why are you testing your data for normality?  For large sample sizes
